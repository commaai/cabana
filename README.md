### errors building libusb modules?

You can safely ignore those errors even though it returns 1. If you'd like them to go away just because they're annoying, install libusb-dev...

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libusb-dev libudev-dev
```

or

```bash
brew install libusb
```

# Create React App documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) v1.x, then upgraded to `react-scripts` v3.x and use [craco](http://npm.im/@craco/craco) to customize it.

You can read the create react app [documentation here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/)

We use craco to easily add [worker-loader](https://npm.im/worker-loader).
